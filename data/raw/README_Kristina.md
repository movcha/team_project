### Topic:  
 Growing Confidence in the Lending Market: Analysis of Trends from 2006 to 2016 Using Tableau

### Objective:  
 To utilize Tableau for a detailed exploration of the lending market trends between 2006 and 2016, focusing on how visual data representation can reveal insights into the increasing confidence within the market.

### Goal:  
To provide a visual and data-driven understanding of the lending marketâ€™s evolution over the decade, identifying key factors that contributed to the growth in lender and borrower confidence, and to create an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to explore these trends dynamically.
### Analysis:   
 - Yearly Trends: the sum of loan amounts from 2006 to 2016, highlighting growth or decline over the years.
 - Regional Performance:  comparing loan amounts across different regions to identify areas of high and low activity.
 - Interest Rate Correlations:  visualizing  the relationship between interest rates and loan volumes, offering insights into how rates influenced lending activity.
 - Hotspot Identification: showing regional loan amounts over the years to identify lending hotspots and areas with lower activity.
 
 ### Audience:  
The primary audience includes financial analysts, bank executives, policy makers, and investors interested in understanding the dynamics of the lending market. The interactive nature of the Tableau visualizations also makes it accessible to business stakeholders who benefit from exploring data in a visual format.
### Design:  
It is  designed for clarity and ease of use, with consistent color schemes and clear labeling. Each visualization is interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific years, regions, or other relevant data points. The design ensures that complex data is presented in an accessible and engaging manner.
### Data:  
- Loan Amounts: Summed annually and regionally.
- Years: Spanning from 2006 to 2016, used to track trends over time.

### Methodologies used:
 1. KNN targets  to classify data points based on their proximity to other points in the dataset.
 2. Logistic Regression aiming  to predicts the probability of asthma occurrence by modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (diagnosis)  and various independent variables (age, gender, ethnicity and education level).

### Topic:  
Identifying Regions with Higher Loan Amounts and Correlating Economic Growth

### Objective:  
To analyze and visualize the relationship between higher loan amounts in specific regions and their correlation with economic growth, using Tableau as the primary tool for data-driven insights.

### Goal:  
To provide a clear understanding of which regions have received the highest loan amounts and how this correlates with indicators of economic growth, offering valuable insights for stakeholders in finance, policy-making, and regional development.
### Analysis:  
 - Regional Loan Distribution: Identifying which regions have higher loan amounts.
- Economic Growth Correlation: Analyzing how these loan amounts correlate with economic growth indicators such as GDP, employment rates, or other relevant economic metrics.
- Comparison Across Regions: Comparing economic performance across regions with varying loan amounts to assess the impact of lending on economic development.
### Audience:  
The primary audience includes economic analysts, regional planners, financial institutions, and government officials interested in understanding the impact of lending on regional economic growth. Investors and businesses looking to make informed decisions about regional markets may also benefit from these insights.
### Design:  
The Tableau dashboard is designed to be intuitive and visually engaging, with interactive elements that allow users to filter data by region or economic indicator. Consistent color schemes and clear labeling help ensure that the data is easily interpretable.
### Data:  
The data used in the Tableau visualizations includes:
- Loan Amounts: Summed regionally to identify areas with higher lending.
- Regions: Categorized for geographical analysis, making it easy to compare economic performance across different areas.
